# Multi-Platform Streaming Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds multi-platform streaming functionality to the dashboard, allowing users to stream simultaneously to YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Platform Selection UI

- **Location**: Added above the streaming section in Dashboard.jsx
- **Functionality**:
  - Checkboxes for YouTube, Twitch, and Facebook
  - Visual indicators showing platform status (configured/not configured)
  - Disabled state when streaming is active
  - Real-time feedback showing selected platforms

### 2. Multi-Socket Connection Management

- **Socket URLs**:
  - YouTube: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Twitch: `http://localhost:5000`
  - Facebook: `http://localhost:6001`
- **Connection Logic**:
  - Connects only to selected platforms
  - Handles connection events properly
  - Sends platform-specific keys on connection

### 3. Enhanced Streaming Logic

- **Key Management**: Fetches and stores keys for all three platforms
- **Multi-Platform Streaming**: Sends stream data to all selected platforms simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Validates platform keys before streaming
- **Connection Status**: Tracks connection and key-sent status per platform

### 4. State Management

- `selectedPlatforms`: Set of selected platforms for streaming
- `connectedSockets`: Object storing socket connections by platform
- `keysSent`: Object tracking which platforms have received keys
- Individual key states: `youtubeKey`, `twitchKey`, `facebookKey`

## How to Use

### 1. Configure Platform Keys

- Use the "Streaming Platforms" section to add RTMP keys for each platform
- Keys are fetched automatically on dashboard load
- Only platforms with configured keys can be selected for streaming

### 2. Select Streaming Platforms

- In the "Select Streaming Platforms" section, check the platforms you want to stream to
- Platforms without keys will be disabled
- Selected platforms are highlighted in blue

### 3. Start Streaming

- Click "Start Streaming" button
- The system will:
  - Connect to selected platform sockets
  - Send keys to respective servers
  - Begin streaming to all selected platforms
- Platform selection becomes disabled during streaming

### 4. Stop Streaming

- Click "Stop Streaming" button
- All socket connections are closed
- Platform selection becomes available again

## Technical Implementation Details

### Socket Connection Flow

1. User selects platforms and clicks "Start Streaming"
2. System validates that at least one platform is selected
3. For each selected platform:
   - Creates socket connection to platform-specific URL
   - Waits for 'connect' event
   - Sends platform key via 'send-key' event
4. Starts MediaRecorder and begins streaming

### Stream Data Distribution

- MediaRecorder captures video/audio data in chunks
- Each chunk is sent to all connected platforms via 'binarystream' event
- Only platforms with successful key authentication receive stream data

### Error Handling

- Validates platform selection before streaming
- Checks for configured keys before connection
- Provides user feedback for missing configurations
- Graceful cleanup on streaming stop

## Backend Requirements

Ensure your backend servers are running on the specified ports:

- YouTube streaming server: `http://localhost:3000`
- Twitch streaming server: `http://localhost:5000`
- Facebook streaming server: `http://localhost:6000`

Each server should handle:

- `send-key` event: Receive and validate platform-specific RTMP keys
- `binarystream` event: Receive and process video stream data

## Future Enhancements

- Add streaming quality selection per platform
- Implement platform-specific streaming settings
- Add real-time viewer count per platform
- Include streaming analytics and metrics
- Add support for additional platforms (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
